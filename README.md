# Bike Tracker with ESP32 (Kolotrek)
## Overview
This is a simple device that allows a bike to be located with the help of GPS. It uses a SIM card for communication by sending and receiving SMS messages. Another nice feature is the "Parking mode", in which an accelerometer checks for movement and warns the owner by calling him if the bike is manipulated.
